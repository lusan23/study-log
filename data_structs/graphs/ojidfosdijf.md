It looks like you're trying to describe a decision-making process based on the state of a `vertex_edge_two` attribute and the existence of a destination vertex (`dest_vtx`) in the context of a vertex and its edges. If I understand correctly, you want to determine whether to handle the vertex based on these conditions.

Here's a tabular representation of the decision-making process:

| `vertex_edge_two` is empty | `vertex.__edge_two.__dest_vtx == None` | Action | Return Value |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| True | True | Handled by edge method | None |
| True | False | Handled by edge method | None |
| False | True | Create a new edge to point to the given vertex, return key of the pointed vertex at `set_edge` | - |
| False | False | Create a new edge to point to somewhere, return key of the pointed vertex at `set_edge` | - |

Note: In the last two rows where a new edge is created, the return value is specified as a dash ("-") because it's not clear from the description what specific value should be returned. You can replace the dash with the appropriate return value or description based on your requirements.

Also, keep in mind that this representation assumes certain conditions and actions based on the information provided. If you have specific code or more context, the table might need adjustment to accurately reflect the logic in your program.
